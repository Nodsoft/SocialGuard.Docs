**NSYS SocialGuard is a centralized Discord Trustlist designed to keep your server safe from known intruders (such as Raiders, Trolls, Chasers, Scammers, Bots, etc).**

At its core, SocialGuard is an API that allows Discord server admins and operators to rapidly and effectively communicate moderation notes, and bans, with each other. With bi-directional communication, SocialGuard can also notify other apps of new records, thus providing near-instant propagation of moderation actions.  

### An Open(-Source) System.
SocialGuard is open to use by any actor, and its records are made available to anyone.
Any server admin/operator can use the records from SocialGuard to secure their own servers, 
and any developer can integrate SocialGuard into their own apps with ease. Security over the records on [socialguard.net](https://socialguard.net)is maintained by the Directory committee at NSYS, who manages emitter permissions to verified and trusted parties.
