# SocialGuard Documentation
### Documentation for the NSYS SocialGuard project and ecosystem
**[socialguard.net/docs](https://socialguard.net/docs)**

---

This vault houses information relating to SocialGuard as an ecosystem and project, and is the go-to reference for API documentation regarding NSYS SocialGuard ([api.socialguard.net](https://api.socialguard.net)).

## Overview

### Concepts
The concepts folder holds information about the core concepts of SocialGuard, similar to a codex. They define the entities present on the API and their role in the system. The definitions/premises detail the concept's idea, whilst the specifications document the current object representing this concept on the API. 
**NB: Concepts will always reflect the latest API spec available (*currently `v3.x`*).**

### Design Proposals
The design proposals reflect drafted concepts and ideas to be implemented in upcoming versions of SocialGuard. These are subject to changes/discard, until frozen by the next specification document.
